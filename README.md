# anagrams

I can't find the original URL for this kata as it seems to be gone. I'm just going off the
version that Joe Bowbeer posted at http://bitbucket.org/joebowbeer/anagrams . 

## Installation

You're best off using leiningen to build and run. A build can be made with
    $ lein uberjar

## Usage

Once you have a jar created

    $ java -jar anagrams-0.1.0-standalone.jar <wordlist-file>
    
Wordlist-file should have one word per line. I used the one in test. It's not robust for
handling punctuation and so forth.
